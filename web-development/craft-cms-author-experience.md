# Features worth mentioning during Craft CMS training

- **Editing images**
  As well as rotating and cropping images, the image editor can be used to set focal points. A focal point will be kept in view in any Craft image transforms.
- **Full screen asset previews**
  With an asset selected use the keyboard shortcut `Shift + Space` to open a full-screen preview.
- **Make quick edits to entries**
  Double click the green dots beside entries to make quick edits, without having to click into entries.
- **Brand the admin area**
  Personalise the login area by adding a logo, site icon and background image (for the login page).
